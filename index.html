    <h1>The Truth About Fast Fashion</h1>
    <p>Understanding the Impact and Making Eco-Friendly Choices</p>
</header>

<section id="planet">
    <h2>Impact on the Planet</h2>
    <p>Fast fashion has a significant impact on the environment. The constant production of cheap clothing leads to excessive water use, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic fibers like polyester shed microplastics, which end up in our oceans and ecosystems, causing harm to wildlife and the environment.</p>
</section>

<section id="people">
    <h2>Impact on People</h2>
    <p>The demand for fast fashion often results in poor working conditions for the people who produce it. Many workers are underpaid, overworked, and subjected to unsafe environments. Supporting fair trade and ethically sourced clothing can help promote fair wages and better working conditions.</p>
</section>

<section id="wastefulness">
    <h2>Wastefulness and Short Lifespan of Garments</h2>
    <p>Fast fashion encourages a throwaway culture, with clothes quickly going out of style or deteriorating after just a few wears. This leads to massive amounts of textile waste in landfills, where synthetic fabrics can take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>

<section id="guide">
    <h2>How to Make Eco-Friendly Fashion Choices</h2>
    <div class="tips">
        <h3>1. Shop Second-Hand</h3>
        <p>Buying second-hand clothes reduces the demand for new clothing production, cutting down on environmental impact. However, be mindful that overbuying second-hand clothing can still contribute to waste. Aim for quality items that youâ€™ll wear repeatedly.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Choose Fair Trade and Ethical Brands</h3>
        <p>Opting for fair trade or ethically certified brands helps support sustainable practices. These brands prioritize workers' rights, environmental protection, and high-quality materials.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Invest in Quality Pieces</h3>
        <p>Rather than buying many cheap items, invest in high-quality pieces that will last. Look for timeless styles and durable materials to create a wardrobe that can withstand trends and wear.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Avoid Synthetic Fabrics</h3>
        <p>Synthetic fabrics like polyester and nylon are made from plastic, shedding microplastics that pollute waterways. Choose natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and wool, but look for organic or sustainably sourced options when possible.</p>
